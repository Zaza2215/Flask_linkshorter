# Hello visitor

This is my test project for a Backend Developer position. I developed a web app that shortens URLs, making them easier to share with friends while maintaining a stylish appearance.

Aslo it helps in these situations:
1. Easy Sharing – Short links are easier to share via messages, emails, or social media.
2. Better Aesthetics – They look cleaner and more professional compared to long, complex URLs.
3. Tracking & Analytics – Many URL shorteners provide click tracking, helping businesses analyze traffic and engagement.
4. Marketing & Branding – Custom short links (e.g., brand.ly/sale) reinforce brand identity.
5. Character Limit Efficiency – Useful for platforms with character limits, like Twitter.
6. Redirection & QR Codes – Shortened URLs are often embedded in QR codes for quick access.
